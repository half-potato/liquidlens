%% Load the variables of the focus sequence:
load imdata2.mat
imdata = imdata2;

% This loads a structure with two fields: images, a 1x30 cell
% array where each cell is a string with the path of one
% frame of the focus sequence; and focus, a 1x30 vector with
% the focus position (in meters) corresponding to each frame
% of the focus sequence. This sequence was generated using:
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55095-defocus-simulation

%% Preview the image sequence:
showimages(imdata.images, imdata.focus, imdata.ROI);

%% Perform SFF using 3-point gaussian interpolation
% as originally proposed by [1] and compute
% reliability according to [2]:

[z, r] = sff(imdata.images, 'focus', imdata.focus);

%% Carve depthmap by removing pixels with R<20 dB:
zc = z;
zc(r<20) = nan;

%% Display the result:
close(gcf), figure
